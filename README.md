It's also possible to snapshot and restore instances!

## Architecture

It's a fullstack application (NextJs) deployed via [SST](https://sst.dev/) on AWS.

## How to run the application locally ?

Run the multiplexer if you want to work with the cron job

```
pnpm install
pnpm sst dev
```

Run to work with the app

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## How to deploy the application

Deploy the infrastructure with SST (front and back stack)
(it push the frontend to S3 and invalidate cloudfront distribution)

```
AWS_REGION=eu-central-1 pnpm sst deploy --stage prod # on aws prod account
AWS_REGION=us-east-1 pnpm sst deploy --stage demo # on aws demo account

```

### Cost center data content

To add cost center list so that the frontend can make use of it, add items directly from the AWS GUI:
visit [DynamoDB section](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodbv2/home)
search for `{stage}-ec2-leaser-config`

See below for an example on how to enter the items in the table:
